/*:
## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let name = "Jen"
print("I declared name as a constant because the vast majority of people have a single name over their entire lives.")
var age = 39
print("I declared age as a variable because it changes every year.")
var stepsToday = 1506
print("I decided to declare the daily step count as a variable since it changes over the course of the day.")
let stepGoal = 8500
print("I made the step goal a constant because goals generally stay the same over time.")
var averageHeartRate = 68
print("The average heart rate is a variable because it fluctuates throughout the day.")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
